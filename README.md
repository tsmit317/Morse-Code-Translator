# Morse Code Translator
Morse Code Translator is a Java program designed to take user defined sentences and translate them to Morse code. 
When the program is started a .txt file containing the morse code equivaltent for each letter, 'Morse.txt', is opened and copied to an array list. 
The user is then prompted to enter an original sentence to be translated. 
Next, each letter in the sentence is compared to the key/value array list and the corresponding morse code is added to a new translation string.
The complete translation is then displayed using JOptionPane and the user is asked if they would like to continue.
